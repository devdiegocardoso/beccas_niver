        <h1>Menina's Riddles</h1>
        <p>Hallo, Menina! I thought about something fun for you as part of your birthday, and what's better than some funny riddles? &#128513;</p>
        <p>Instructions</p>
        <ol>
            <li>This game is similar as the Hangman game.</li>
            <li>You have 6 tries to solve all the riddles.</li>
            <li>There are a total of 5 riddles to solve.</li>
            <li>For every mistake done, the poor guy will suffer the consequence.</li>
            <li>Bitte, try to save him! He's a nice guy hehe. (Maybe his name is Diego &#128518;)</li>
            <li>But don't be afraid, you can always start again!</li>
            <li>Every riddle represents in some way the gifts that Mari and I are going to give you.</li>
            <li>If one of the riddles is so hard, you can press the hint button. (I know, I'm so nice &#128518;).</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>I hope you have fun &#128521;</p>
